#3D Rotation Drawing

I tried to create a drawing board with 3d motion .

## Summary

In my final project, I tried to use p5 to create a drawing board. For the programming part, I used a lot of variables and if statements to create the rotation and colorful buttons. For the 3D Rotation, I focused on the nod and time past and frequency to create the rotation. And it is interactive with the brush .

## Component Parts

This painting system is an extension of the concept of "painting", but still needs to reflect the similarity with the traditional painting system

## Timeline

What did you do in each of the past four weeks?

- Week 1: Write Proposal, flush out initial code for your idea
- Week 2: Changed my original ideas and look at videos seeking for new ideas. Partly finished the basic coding for the motion.
Week 3: Adding more function buttons and sound to completely finish the coding
- Week 4: Present!
 
## Challenges

I watched some video and learned how to create the 3d rotation. But the math part is still really hard to understand. And the sin,cos,is pretty hard for art students. Fortunately, I asked some of my firends to help me.!
